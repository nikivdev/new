# f commit

AI-powered commit with code review and GitEdit sync.

## Overview

Stages all changes, runs AI code review for bugs and security issues, generates a commit message, commits, pushes, and syncs AI sessions to gitedit.dev.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Standard commit with review
f commit

# Commit without pushing
f commit -n

# Include AI context in review
f commit --context

# Custom message
f commit -m "Fixes #123"
```

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--no-push` | `-n` | Skip pushing after commit |
| `--sync` | | Run synchronously (don't delegate to hub) |
| `--context` | | Include AI session context in code review |
| `--dry` | | Dry run: show context without committing |
| `--codex` | | Use Codex instead of Claude for review |
| `--review-model <MODEL>` | | Choose specific review model |
| `--message <MSG>` | `-m` | Custom message appended to commit |
| `--tokens <N>` | `-t` | Max tokens for AI context (default: 1000) |

## Review Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `claude-opus` | Claude Opus 1 for review (default) |
| `codex-high` | Codex high-capacity (gpt-5.1-codex-max) |
| `codex-mini` | Codex mini (gpt-5.1-codex-mini) |

```bash
# Use Codex
f commit --codex

# Specific model
f commit --review-model codex-high
```

## What Happens

1. **Safety Checks**
   - Warns about sensitive files (.env, .pem, keys, credentials)
   - Warns about files with large diffs (500+ lines)

2. **Stage Changes**
   - Runs `git add -A` to stage all changes

3. **Code Review**
   - Sends diff to AI for review
   - Checks for bugs, security issues, best practices
   - Optionally includes AI session context (`--context`)

4. **Generate Message**
   - AI generates commit message from diff
   - Appends custom message if provided (`-m`)

5. **Commit**
   - Creates commit with generated message

6. **Push**
   - Pushes to remote (unless `--no-push`)

7. **GitEdit Sync**
   - Syncs AI session data to gitedit.dev

## Usage Examples

### Basic Commit

```bash
# Review, commit, and push
f commit
```

### Local Commit Only

```bash
# Don't push to remote
f commit -n
```

### With AI Context

Include recent AI session context in the review:

```bash
f commit --context
f commit --context --tokens 2000  # More context
```

### Custom Message

Append additional context to the commit:

```bash
f commit -m "Fixes #123"
f commit -m "Co-authored-by: John <john@example.com>"
```

### Dry Run

See what would be reviewed without committing:

```bash
f commit --dry
```

### Synchronous Mode

Run directly without delegating to hub:

```bash
f commit --sync
```

---

## Safety Warnings

### Sensitive Files

Before committing, flow warns if staging files that look sensitive:

```
⚠ Warning: The following sensitive files are staged:
  - .env
  - credentials.json
  - private.key
```

Sensitive patterns include:
- `.env`, `.env.*`
- `credentials.json`, `secrets.json`
- `.pem`, `.key`, `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`
- Files containing `password`, `secret`, `token`

### Large Diffs

Warns about files with significant changes:

```
⚠ Warning: The following files have large diffs:
  - src/generated.rs (1523 lines)
  - data/fixtures.json (834 lines)
```

Threshold: 500+ lines added/removed.

## Related Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `f commit` | Full review + GitEdit sync (default) |
| `f commitWithCheck` | Review without GitEdit sync |
| `f commitSimple` | No review, just AI commit message |

### commitWithCheck (alias: cc)

Same as `commit` but skips GitEdit sync:

```bash
f commitWithCheck
f cc  # Short alias
```

### commitSimple

Quick commit without code review:

```bash
f commitSimple
```

---

## Configuration

### Hub Delegation

By default, `f commit` delegates to the hub daemon for async processing. Use `--sync` for direct execution:

```bash
# Async via hub (default)
f commit

# Sync (direct)
f commit --sync
```

### AI Session Context

When `--context` is enabled, includes recent Claude Code session context:

```bash
# Default: 1000 tokens of context
f commit --context

# More context
f commit --context --tokens 3000
```

---

## Examples

### Quick Bug Fix

```bash
# Fix bug, commit with context
vim src/lib.rs
f commit --context -m "Fixes null pointer in edge case"
```

### Feature Branch

```bash
# Work on feature
git checkout -b feature/new-api
# ... make changes ...

# Commit without push
f commit -n

# More changes...
f commit -n

# Final push
git push -u origin feature/new-api
```

### Review Before Commit

```bash
# See what would be reviewed
f commit --dry

# If satisfied, commit
f commit
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Sensitive files staged"

Either:
1. Add files to `.gitignore`
2. Unstage with `git reset HEAD <file>`
3. Proceed anyway if intentional

### Review taking too long

Use `--sync` to see progress directly:
```bash
f commit --sync
```

### Hub not responding

Fall back to sync mode:
```bash
f commit --sync
```
